    <div class="class-two">
      <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds is a a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and, historically, the main developer of the Linux kernel, used by Linux distributions and other operating systems such as Android. He also created the distributed revision control system Git and the scuba dive logging and planning software Subsurface.</p>
      <p>At the age of 10, Linus started writing programs in BASIC on his maternal grandfather’s Commodore Vic 20. This is when he discovered his love for computers and programming and though he preferred to spend time on computers rather than in athletic activities, he had to attend compulsory military training. He held the rank of Second Lieutenant.</p>
      <p><img src="./images/university logo.png"alt="university logo" class="class-pi">Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki from 1988 to 1996, graduating with a master's degree in computer science. His M.Sc. thesis was titled Linux: A Portable Operating System. Red Hat and VA Linux, both leading developers of Linux-based software, presented Torvalds with stock options in gratitude for his creation.In 1999, both companies went public and Torvalds' net worth shot up to roughly $20 million. Torvalds moved to San Jose, California and lived there for several years with his family. In June of 2004, Torvalds and his family moved to Portland, Oregon to be closer to Linus's place of work. He worked for Transmeta from February 1997 until June 2003, and is now seconded to the Open Source Development Lab, a Beaverton, Oregon based software consortium.</p>
      <p>Unlike many open source evangelists, Torvalds maintains a low profile and generally refuses to comment on competing software products. Torvalds generally stays out of non-kernel-related debates. He has been criticized for his neutrality by the free software movement, specifically for having worked on proprietary software with Transmeta and for his use and alleged advocacy of the proprietary BitKeeper software (for version control in the Linux kernel, BitKeeper was replaced by git in June, 2005). Torvalds has commented on official GNOME developmental mailing lists that, in terms of desktop environments, he encourages users to switch to KDE. Torvalds often finds himself in the middle of competing ideologies: on one hand he is an established icon of open-source and free software, yet on the other he has supported the use of the proprietary software BitKeeper to help manage the Linux kernel and has stated that Linux may include technology supporting digital rights management for pragmatic reasons.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Linus Torvalds is the creator of Linux which  is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991.</li>
        <li>Torvalds wrote the kernel of the Linux operating system at age 21 from his mother’s apartment in Helsinki. </li>
        <li>Most people know Linus Torvalds for creating the Linux kernel. But he also created Git, a version control system that is extensively used in software development worldwide. Till 2005, (then) proprietary service BitKeeper was used for Linux kernel development. When Bitkeeper shut down its free service, Linus Torvalds created Git on his own because none of the other version control systems met his needs.Git allows developers to control versions and distribute beta and stable versions to end-users. Git keeps strict control of code changes, keeps a log of changes, and lets developers merge versions of their software.</li>
        <li>In 2003, Torvalds left Transmeta to focus exclusively on the Linux kernel, backed by the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL), a consortium formed by high-tech companies, which included IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, AMD, RedHat, Novell and many others. The purpose of the consortium was to promote Linux development. OSDL merged with The Free Standards Group in January 2007 to become The Linux Foundation. Torvalds remains the ultimate authority on what new code is incorporated into the standard Linux kernel.</li>
